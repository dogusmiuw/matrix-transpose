# Transposing a Matrix in Java
Sometimes you could need to transpose a matrix. For example while working on linear algebra. The main logic is writing the elements in matrixâ€™s row as a column.

I choose Java to do this however you can use any language. If even the syntax changes, the main logic always will be the same.
